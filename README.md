# magicXform-utils
This repository contains results, insights, experiments, and challenges related to the magicXform tool. Below, you'll find an overview of the project structure, experiments conducted, and key findings.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into several folders:

### Experiment Folder: 
Contains subfolders for different experiments conducted with the tool.
- exp-benchmarks: Contains versions 0 to 5 of benchmarks transformed using magicXform. These are utilized to assess whether the spacer could resolve certain issues. Also includes utils files for running spacer on versions.
- macos: Holds results from experiments conducted on a MacBook Air 2023 with 16GB RAM (considered unstable).
- snufkin: Experiment conducted on a Ubuntu machine at the University of Waterloo using the parallel tool with 8-16 jobs. Data from this experiment was found to be unreliable due to overlapping experiments.
- snufkin_2: Follow-up experiment to snufkin, conducted with 4 jobs for more stable results.

### All-challenges Folder:
 Contains all original 58 plain benchmarks for reference.

### Results Folder: 
Contains notes related to experiment insights or other thoughts.

## Experiments Conducted

- exp-benchmarks: Six versions of benchmarks transformed using magicXform, along with spacer usage for issue resolution assessment.

- macos: Experiment results from a MacBook Air 2023 with 16GB RAM, noted for instability.

- snufkin: Experiment conducted on a Ubuntu machine at the University of Waterloo, using the parallel tool with 8-16 jobs. Data was deemed unreliable due to overlapping experiments.

- snufkin_2: Follow-up experiment with 4 jobs for more stable results.

## Insights and Challenges

Throughout the experiments, various insights and challenges were encountered, including issues with data reliability, stability on certain systems, and the efficacy of the spacer tool in resolving transformation issues.
